# Wine-Quality

• This project involves using Python to analyze and classify wine quality based on a dataset of red wine features.
• The dataset was explored and visualized to understand its structure, feature relationships, and quality distribution. This involved generating summary statistics and visual plots such as bar plots and heatmaps.
• A Random Forest Classifier was trained to predict wine quality based on these features.
• The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 92.8% on the test data, indicating high performance in classifying wine quality. Predictions were made on sample data to assess the quality of wine as either "Good" or "Bad."
